Alisson Naimayer, born in Brazil, 1993, fullstack developer, can speak native portuguese, fluent english and intermediate french.

Learn programming Python in 2011, adding PHP, Javascript and HTML soon after aiming to become a web developer. Currently working with Laravel for REST APIs, while using mainly VueJS to build the front end. MariaDB or PostgreSQL as the main choices for database, and some experience in previous jobs using Oracle Database and SQLServer.

Recently looking to expand my tool stack by learning and using Python Django for web systems and Hugo for static sites.

As for hobbies: [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/alisson.nmr/), helps to clear my mind, keep creative, and look for the best wherever I am. And currently leaning to play piano.
